# odin-landing-page

This project will have me recreating a webpage from an image of a
supplied design. Through this, I should demonstrate proficiency in the use of CSS and Flexbox styling, as well as sectioning code in HTML. I will also establish a baseline independence from the coursework via searching the internet for minor details that the coursework intention does not supply.
